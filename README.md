## MORE ON THE PROJECT
This web application is built on React Library. It uses the herokku API https://movied.herokuapp.com/discover. from which 
data is being fetched and then the response object is handled to give the web-page visuals.

Two sections are highlighted on the web page, the Discover section where all movies are hosted and there are options to add each movie, as per
user preference to the 'My List' section. Also, the details option navigates to a another page to give a more detailed view on the movie and it's plot.
This page also has option to navigate back to homepage.

CSS has been used to do the styling of the web-page rendering.
